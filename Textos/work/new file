I have an IP product to negotiate. I am willing propose this escheme: 
12,25% percent of actions based on that idea will be directed to the market at beggining(as long as it should not be monopolized, so you will need to have a partner at this). The resultant amount will be divided into: 
24,5%(to develop the further projects within the IP and it's actual and future eventual developer(s)); 
12,25% (Enviromental Changes¹); 
51% (Research and Development of Human Knowledge Aplication Funding²);

¹ Enviromental changes: Fund directed to modernize human enviroment, making research results part of each one's lives.
² Research and Development of Human Knowledge Aplication Funding: Directed to provide funds to develop open-source 																	projects related to technical(research/test) and 																	artisctic productions permiting they to continuously 																	flowing within those aspects.
