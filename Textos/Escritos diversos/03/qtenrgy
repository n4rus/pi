"The predictions are based on a principle called the Born rule, but it has its own problems, as Anil Ananthaswamy explains for New Scientist:

"[T]here is no fundamental reason why the Born rule should hold. It seems to work in all the situations weâ€™ve tested, but no one knows why. 

Some have attempted to derive it from the 'many worlds' interpretation of quantum mechanics, which proposes that all the possible states of a quantum system could exist in different, parallel universes - but such attempts have been inconclusive."" ~ http://www.sciencealert.com/this-classic-physics-experiment-could-finally-reveal-the-long-awaited-theory-of-everything


	Quantum particles are embed with our universe energy/frequency, so they suffer less from space-time interference than the macroscopic world(they are more energetic). As we add potential energy to macro bodies, they start to have the potential to act as a quantun particle, going beyond time-bounded macro worlds. Following, a black hole can be seen as a star that reaches the energy levels to behave as a quantum particle, going beyond our dimension of time-space.
	The necessary amount of energy(E) to go Quantum(Q), must be related to the mass and frequency, as Quantum Potential(Qp). If the Quantum Potential becomes greater than the energy range, the whole body goes quantum, being able to exist in another time-space domain.
	
((E=hf)/(mass.speed))=Qp
