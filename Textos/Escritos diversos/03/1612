Homo sapiens physics are used as a tool to understand the mechanics of human universe.
Applying entropy to thermodynamics, physics can explain how planets como to exist,
thus, how homo sapiens emerged sentient. 
But all those understandings, are related to human dimensions(physical: 3D axis + time;
plus the relativity caused from being observers bounded to human perspectives), and
they can just help the understanding from inside the bubble(human compreension dimensions).
Stills, if humans somehow manage to solve the puzzle, they overcome the problem, going beyond
the frontiers of whats possible to be understood. Reading show us the heeirloom worlds that the 
writer gave us, and science(thus physics), uses this technologycal tool to create even more advanced tools,
that can go even beyond the physical worlds and realms.
The new start points are all over the place, we can begin from the newest truths that are alredy written, and
acessible, questioning the paths, ourselves, and the universe, with the most dense questions that our minds can 
produce. That's how we use stored knowledge to create and seek from whitin.
