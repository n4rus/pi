 				 Note 1

 	Every time we add information from the virtual mind lines into our timeline, we change the future and throught the caos, altering the future events that follows the flow of human information and action.


 				 Note 2

 	An individual can add info to the time line, but what can the one do beyond that? I am just it, so how can I make sense, and how can I do something that goes beyond mainstream human reality? The I can be the answer, going beyond the I of self, plus the I of humanity, seeking into the deep of our higher insights, trying to see what we lack, trying to know the answer that goes within and beyond it own contradiction.
