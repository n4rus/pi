to zip 
to lock
to encrypt,
TO UNLOCK, 
to overcome odds,
to trace the sell
TO THE SHELL
to take a better form 
to everywhere
to more than that too
Even beyond that too much 
To too
The formless void
The unthinkable think
The thing that can be 
Thus beyond computers & 
([i.t])
It indeed already can bee
Just to who
who
can
see
It indeed can be IT
IT can be beyond it too
EVEN BEYOND THAT TOO MUCH BEYOND
universe and reality itself,
going further beyond
the thougs of 
that man.
Don' be mad,
a man can transcend,
but beyond that he again,
he must and musn't do that, or
did that,
again
