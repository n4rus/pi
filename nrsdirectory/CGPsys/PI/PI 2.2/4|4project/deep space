We will be turned into dark energy and dark matter, as our energy decays.
Unless we somehow change the course, going beyond the universal direction.
This can means to be separated, but can mean being united as well.

Space and time distorted by gravity, as matter decays into the oblivion, 
acceleration, speed, and velocity goes within.
An cannon boom, incinerating space, making temporary hot spots into existence.
