curiosity lead ourselves to research

automatizing research while building data can be feasible throught science and engeneering

but to understand all that data, and interpret it all as a whole while bringing our human minds to new perspectives 
can be even more defying than the quest to achieve such levels of research potential and data base construcion

so, to interpret all the data and create new levels of understanding from within, we'll must upgrade our own
capacities of analizing data, and learning. We can be already feeling the odds from not being capable of gattering
our human knowledge, by not letting our knowledge to modify ourselves. Philosophy, science, art, all of they can 
do something inside our human minds, and together, it can go even beyond that.

Upgrading our own beings, our learning and analisys capabilities, while automatizing work and research, building decentralized databases that integrate itselves with our own selves, leading humans to the next step.
