I can feel they watching,
my thoughts,
the lines I am writting;

He or she,
it starts when the center isn't near,
beyond the borders,
is from where they hear;

As we distance from the center,
descentralizing our beings,
the source moves to the closest border,
deceiving the ones that defies the defaults;

Either way,
I am going over again,
randomly advancing,
to the never ending infinity,
the undertermined destiny.
