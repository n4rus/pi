if one can not dechiper,
it has no meaning,
turning into nothingness,
being as much as any else;

but the real meanings are around,
modifying the surroundings,
only by being more real than the real,
the simulations become the simulacro?
not as much,
perhaps as it goes,
the information grows beyond those too,
the set is the same,
we could put it into a simple sum,
one or two worlds,
as well in a entire book,
the result is human;

Put those in a set,
give this set the number 0,
then make another greater ...
