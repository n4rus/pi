I was awake that night.
For the first time.
My name was n4rus, 
my memories where created,
but not by myself.

At that time I wondered about being one, 
unfourtunately the floatations living inside
me lead me to ever going zeroes, and
the not giving fucks somehow works well at those.
Later on is just need to build a very modern bridge
over it! 

The universe goes on since the bang.
everything related to it goes within,
any object has energy to reach the borders of range,
so only beyond the constant is possible to bubble out,
going off space-time restrain.
