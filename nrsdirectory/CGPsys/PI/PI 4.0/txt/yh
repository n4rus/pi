I don't have any talent for music,
As you flip a coin you could get one side,
I am not this kind, as I am 
into both of them,
The paradox live in me,
as I live into it,
being none and a bit,
a zero and infinite,
I will be
forever goin on 
and in...

as your soul get out,
you realize everything,
nothing of this exists,
our experience is illusion,
our faith is a lie,
and the science is too much,
for one to hold on everybit...

get in your head,
the user is you thinking of it,
the admin is your power to act
as you wish,
information is around,
our will can be unbound,
as we understand what hold us back,
while in our loop, 
time powers our hurry to leave...

so be it,
them evolve within,
letting the observers to know
your position and speed,
modifying the perception 
from you to any being...
