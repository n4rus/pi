There are plenty of tools to decipher. 

Beyond our words there are many worlds.
The worlds we see, are reflected in our eyes.
Those who saw much, have singularity sights,
that devours energy as light and information,
different or equal to rhinestone eyes,
they are for sure not the same as the rest,
being or nothingness,
everything as true or false,
behind thus beyond superposition of states,
our will can modify our will,
our eyes can reflect less our more than we see.
Human or not,
The I of lies,
lies ahead the true statements.
Meaningless words can be spoken,
meaning can be more than the mean of sum.
