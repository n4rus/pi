everything is easy as shit,
as long as it can be did.

Talking trash realy does not help,
even so,
it is part of this and that.

The conclusion is the reverse
engineering, that can be done
at the physical levels and

The possible can exist beyond proof,
from the observer's point of view.
In a diferent position in time or space
the observer can get the possibility of
proof, thus getting ways to surpass the
previous gaps in understanding the possible.
