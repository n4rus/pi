The universe is expanding, so the effect of expansion is observed between
that are travelling with it, in an expansion escale and constant. The 
acceleration is going since begging, nowdays it is not so fast as it was
back then, but the space continues to grow. 

If a particle becomes isolated from others in a quantum box, the particle
are still going with the universe expansion constant, and the gravitational
tendrils still holds it in place, being only distorted by the noise from
g-waves.

gravitational-tendrils = gt

Expansion Constant = ExC

time = t

mass = m

particle-mass = mp

Determined-position = D

 t = D * ( mp * Exc * gt )


scape-velocity = s

 ExCs > Exc * gt * m
