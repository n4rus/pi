<p>Each world is a variable, each object, character, text, form, order, disorder
<p>...
<p>nothing in it is more than any other x</p>

<p>as even if it is a lie, or a bunch of lies in a bigger one that exists</p>

<p>within the infite variations of finite infinites or whatever else,</p>

<p>the contrapoint of those lies must be something close to the system of</p>

<p>realities where we have ourselves based, as mathemathics and physics,</p>

<p>including the language of humanity, that is a logical system based on human</p>
<p>hardware, carrying the dna kernel as the human operating system</p>

<p>the language here is translated from another one,
<p>so it is rudimentar, even more than the original,
<p>the real deal lies into the ideas that flows from it into your mind.
<p>Well, in my mind too, than we can use it to empower our own ideas, as well
<p>to improve our goals, aiming further, comprehendind all horizons,
<p>surpassing stakes into planing the planning, flying freely to our answers.
