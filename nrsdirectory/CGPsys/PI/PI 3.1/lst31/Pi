E = Energy
Pi = Particle information
r = range
m = mass
f = field

E = Pi * rÂ² * mf


Each particle has an energy that carries it throught space, from emission
to fade-out or a collison with something else.

At light speeds photons could been seen as rain drops if the local interference
could be isolated. Positions are determinated within information exchange,
resulting in noise at quantum levels. The noise starts within the particle,
and stops when the position is being determined.

Since each particle follows up the cosmic movent, it carries only this kinectic
energy, wich may appear to be weak at smaller scales, but only because at
quantum scales, for example, the energy per square meter tends to be much
higher, and that is exactly what makes easy for local interaction make noise
and determine particle postions.
