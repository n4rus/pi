Space get curved by mass, thus energy;
While quantum entanglement can link a pair of particles
jumping between the curved space, not being affected by the 
local time dilatation, giving the obeserver the a measure close to
instant percepction of time.

The information goes straight instead of following the space-time 
curvature from local distortions.


<!-- not that good at algebra yet!!!!!!! :(

space-time-distortion = std

energy = e

quantum-particles = qp

interation-time = it

it = qp * it / e * std
