Eu sou criativo,
e a criatividade solta,
pode sim, 
causar estranhamento;

o choque é do novo com o velho,
o real com o surreal,
a antiga quimera contra a nova e mutada;

Durante o embate, 
novos codigos memeticos sao gerados,
memorias e projecoes que se espalham a partir do individuo;

Eu sou um impulso:
tao forte quanto um big bang,
tao flutuante quanto o quanta e os além detalhes.

Time/(3*distance(particle-details[quanta{energy}])

An object exists while it's particles radiates flying within the gravitational
pull from greater cosmic events.
Quanta are bounded to atoms, as atoms make molecules and genetic coding. All 
those systems are bounded to the inflational movement and the galatic movement,
so they are moving within greater bodies as they move according to the entropic 
systems that are bounded as well.

New physical visions are born from this visions, as quanta are bounded to the 
greater scales. Particle interaction defines their positions as they travel
throught time.

Space is a kind of distortion in time, if there is no time, there is no space 
to be measured. A dimension being distorted into a space-time-dimension where
details get more and more detailed because of energy radiation. As energy fades
out, the universe gets more entropic and complex, thermodinamics and other 
laws can even make no much sense at certain poins, as they can not do much
in other universes or scenarios.
