Nova Caverna

A Caverna agora é moderna,
tecnológica demais para a percepção;

No mundo externo as feras morreram:
Os homens das cavernas ancestrais as assasinaram, 
tornando-se feras modernas;

As sombram também foram extintas,
feras modernas aprenderam a manipular as luzes,
e com artificios artificias escodem as sombras em
tranparências quase invisiveis,
Escondendo a imperfeição dos limites perceptíveis.




new cave

The Cavern now is modern,
too much technological for perception;

In the external world the beasts died:
The man of ancestral caves have slaughtered them,
becoming modern beasts;

The shadows had got extinct as well,
modern beasts had learned to control the lights,
and with artificial artifices they hide the shadows in
almost invisible transparencies,
Hiding the imperfection of perceptible limits.
