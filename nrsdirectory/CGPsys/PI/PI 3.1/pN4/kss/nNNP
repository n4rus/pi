I don`t like networking. I like to explore, alone sometimes...
The network can make our efforts arise to the world of other individuals,
even if we may be not.

Systems can do the networking, as we may be able to improve our time spending.
Money becomes energy, measurable and traceable to the source in nature, 
encrypted into an entropic system, mined from users efforts. Those efforts
from users are prefed to be improved at humnity rates, being the best the user
can know and do at the time of its evolution through knowledge,
even if user learn everything, it can loop at everything again.
Then it turns into a new system.
