"The good master serves all";
\linebreak
so I was trying any,
\linebreak
so now I try any too, 
\linebreak
and to serve even myself,
\linebreak
being that one of my interests.

      \paragraph{}
The outcomes are results from the variables contained in everything.
\linebreak
Each world is a variable, each object, character, text, form, order, disorder
\linebreak
...
\linebreak
Nothing in it is more than any other x
\linebreak
as even if it is a lie, or a bunch of lies in a bigger one that exists
\linebreak
within the infite variations of finite infinites or whatever else,
\linebreak
the contrapoint of those lies must be something close to the system of
\linebreak
realities where we have ourselves based, as mathemathics and physics,
\linebreak
including the language of humanity, that is a logical system based on human
\linebreak
hardware, carrying the dna kernel as the human operating system
\linebreak
the language here is translated from another one,
\linebreak
so it is rudimentar, even more than the original,
\linebreak
the real deal lies into the ideas that flows from it into your mind.
\linebreak
Well, in my mind too, than we can use it to empower our own ideas, as well
\linebreak
to improve our goals, aiming further, comprehendind all horizons, 
\linebreak
surpassing stakes into planing the planning, flying freely to our answers.
