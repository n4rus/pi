"The good master serves all";
so I was trying any,
so now I try any too, 
and to serve even myself,
being that one of my interests.

The outcomes are results from the variables contained in everything.
Each world is a variable, each object, character, text, form, order, disorder
...
nothing in it is more than any other x

as even if it is a lie, or a bunch of lies in a bigger one that exists

within the infite variations of finite infinites or whatever else,

the contrapoint of those lies must be something close to the system of

realities where we have ourselves based, as mathemathics and physics,

including the language of humanity, that is a logical system based on human
hardware, carrying the dna kernel as the human operating system

the language here is translated from another one,
so it is rudimentar, even more than the original,
the real deal lies into the ideas that flows from it into your mind.
Well, in my mind too, than we can use it to empower our own ideas, as well
to improve our goals, aiming further, comprehendind all horizons, 
surpassing stakes into planing the planning, flying freely to our answers.
