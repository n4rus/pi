project goal: self-sustainable spaceship, climatized for earth life

project includes: new_energy-transformation-plans, new_gravitation technology,
	new_propulsion system, new_web, new_resources-managment, new_coin, 
	self-sustainable-residencies, isolation_system, 
	new_large-scale-production-plans

consumption = energy required for peer to function

new_energy-transformation-plans = goal: each peer seed if peer > consumption; 
					for peer seed + 1energy: coin +=1;
				uses solar, wind, fusion, and other renewable
				sources, preffering the most advanced.

new_coin = ecrypt : energy generation/consumption based, desentralized

new_resources-managment = blockchain-crypt, manages energy-transformation thus
			ecoin

new-gravitation-technology = enables ships to avoid bad aerodynamics and 
			reduces energy costs expended in propultion 

new_propulsion-system = works within the new-grav

new_web = public info about the integrated systems; encrypted transactions(w2)

w2 = new_web-private-version(secure-crypt)

self-sustainable-residencies = holds all needings of a modern human: 
	     food indoor cultivation; energy: decentralized; web: decentralized
					      local-web-grid      local-web
					      commom-grid         commom-web
								  new_web(w2)
	     and water and sewer analog to energy.
						
isolation_system = holds self-sustainable-residencie making it ready for space

new_large-scale-production-plans = decentralized crowdfunding to explore 
				frontiers of tomorrow. 3D print, local,
				commom production, open-souce, free-source,
				sercive time based payment, meritocracy.

power_suit = expands human survival capabilities in hostile enviroments. 
	Holds techs from all systems described. Can enhance or add function to
	the body. Space, underwater, flight, thermal resistent.
