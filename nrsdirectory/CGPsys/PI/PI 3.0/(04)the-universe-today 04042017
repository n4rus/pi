The universe today, if backtracked,
Can show the energy radiating as 
it expands.
The initial momentum hold much
more energy than any place today.
The entropy of black holes ares
oposite to the initial fase.
Bangs momentun holds things close by 
interaction correlation, and even if universe 
expand, and particles radiate, the set of rules
stated by the first interations and
floatations, shall follow within the 
energy.
