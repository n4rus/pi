									Gravity waves offers resistance to mass,
									as fluids, since fluids have much more 
									mass per(square meter) atmo tham many stars,
									gravity resistance frequencie must
									be far less than attrict.
									A radiation wave that spreads freely
									around particles and filos, being able
									to multiply it's speed by the surrounding
									sincronous waves.
To be tested/researched:
	Gravity as short waves emited by matter
	acting localy, being multiplied
	by the mass or particle quantity
	and density
