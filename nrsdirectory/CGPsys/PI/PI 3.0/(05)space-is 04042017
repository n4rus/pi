Space is invisible energy, 
or cooled matter.

If we observe the energy,
than it's not space at the momento.

In all other momentos, can be space,
or any-energy anywhere else.

Sp = Bbe
      T

After big bang; Energy has been spreading as radiation.
The expansion observed in universe, comes from bang,
and goes on while paricles recycle and decay, holding
then togheter within the expansion constant and quantum
entanglement.
Black holes are examples of high density information
energy that distorts it's surroundings heavly, much 
like universe, they start hot, then entropy make the
energy hard to detect. It's too much energy/info,
they are homogeneous and not, as it is not there.
The applied observation techique must be indirect.
